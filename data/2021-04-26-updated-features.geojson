No matter where I went, I was slightly out-of-place. And so it became, that out of the necessity to invent a place to belong, poetry found me. My poetic instincts were formed from the sights and sounds of those immigrant streets and the vibrations of roads and buildings that were both familiar and foreign. It is the poetry of a body and heart learning its new language in secrecy.",

So far, that has evaded me because all my frothy little pieces turn into much deeper work when I expand them.\nBut this little mystery series--perhaps I could call it “flash mysteries”?--may finally accomplish that lighter purpose. I love San Jose and the tremendous variety of cool people who make it the hidden treasure it is. That’s why I gave my protagonist a multi-ethnic identity using surnames one can easily find in San Jose. I’ve long wanted to set a mystery series here, looking at our quirks and foibles (in a mostly loving way) and our gifts and talents while promoting laughter and hope. I also teach creative writing at De Anza and CreatorSchoolCA.com and private workshops where I've met so many creative San Joseans (Is that the name for San Jose residents?) \n",

        "text submission": "Excerpt from the first installment in a San Jose Mystery Series: Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes by Lita Kurth\n       Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes throughout the greater San Jose area.”\n      The woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”\n      Lydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.\n      Soon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”\n      “I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.\n      “This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”\n      Lydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”\n      “I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.\n Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”\n      The woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”\n      “I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “\nShe surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”\n      “Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”\n      Quietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.\nWhen Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.\n      “How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”\n      “About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly,       “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. CONTACT LITA FOR THE CONCLUSION!\n\n"

They can’t stand still \nfor long lest their muscles begin to cool and cramp. \nThey can’t wait to descend, to arrive at the coffee shop \nin full regalia and check today’s trail off their list. \nFor them, one switch-backed, fat-burning ascent \nmay very well be mistaken for another.\n\nAnd there are those for whom the hike is a social \nouting—a chance to walk their dogs and complain \nof their lot: their inattentive spouse, their burdensome \nchildren. When they finally stumble across the bench \nin the clearing, Fido straining at the leash, tongue \nlolling, they sit just long enough to water the animal and \nready the plastic baggie for collection. They’ve missed \nthe quail and white-tailed deer, the rattlesnake and \npainted ladies flittering among trailside thistles. \nNo wild thought has intruded upon their day.\n\nAnd then there are those lonesome fools for whom \nthe trail is a listening post on the universe. Attuned to \nthe daily office of blossom and rot, their ears are pricked up \nfor mystery borne upon the liquid rustle of summer leaves. \nTheir eyes wander towards the shadowy undergrowth, \nthe wagging branch, the tremendous wings slicing \nacross the sky. They break through at the startling peak \njust as the breeze’s lullaby chimes its final notes. \nStalked by some divine commotion, they gaze \nover the fertile valley, speechless, attentive, still.\n"

She thinks\nsleeping with men is more than a sin,\nmy father says, as we sit on the curb\nin front of someone else’s house.\nSixty-four years have made my father\nimpotent. Silver roots, faded black\ndye mottling his hair make him look\nalmost comical, as if his shame\nbelonged to me. Last night we read\nThoreau in a steak house down the road\nand wept: If a man does not keep pace\nwith his companions, let him travel\nto the music that he hears, however\nmeasured or far away. The orchards\nare gone, his village near Shanghai\nbombed by the Japanese, the groves\nI have known in Almaden—apricot,\nwalnut, peach and plum—hacked down.\n\n\n\n\t \nCanker\n\n\nThe wound would not heal for days. But that was nothing compared to my mother who ran her mouth all over my body.\n\nWhat people will do to be remembered.\n\nThe nurses cutting roses from the cards I sent have put them in a tub of scalding water. The kisses have come undone.\n\nStamps are all she can save, arranging them in a book like all the photographs she could never take.\n\nI have managed to piece together the pages she tore away from me. Though the box of letters burned, the ashes were not entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day after Christmas break, my father was driving me back to school, the two-lane highway on fire, everything falling. \n\nTo me, their divorce was never final, only a precarious extension, a bridge I had learned to walk between two cliffs.\n\nI remember blood on the dining-room floor and a few drops down his cheek when I broke a chair over his back. It wasn’t damaged beyond repair, but it was put away in the attic.\n\nAnd I thought, if only Mother knew. The county had already locked her up for the first time that year: her neighbors had complained about sacks of garbage she threw from her balcony into the swimming pool below.\n\nI still can hear her voice that day in junior high when I was called out of class. She said to me in the backseat,\n\nLove me, let me die,\n\nher head bobbing in my lap, floating in its pool of chemicals. The woman who couldn’t get in to clean drove us to the emergency room.\n\nLet me die.\n\nThat’s all I heard when I broke into her bedroom, the pills scattered on the floor like a broken necklace.\n\nShe lived. That night there was a canker in the back of my throat. I couldn’t eat for days. My father opened cans of a protein drink he’d brought home from the hospital.\n\nDrink this. Now sleep. Good.\n\nThat was the first time I remember being held. I told my father at the end of our trip. I told him about the men who came into my life. The pain that made me feel alive.\n\nMy father wept as we swerved to the side of the road. Then he began to speak, stoking a bed of ashes that years could not put out:\n\nYour aunt wrote me while you had stayed with them, still a baby. You’d scream if your mother came into the room where you were being bathed. Her sister told her not to touch you but she did.\n\nI wanted this to stop. Why couldn’t anyone stop her?\n\nThere are no photographs of you then. She wouldn’t have them in the house reminding her.\n\nMy mother entered me with a kiss.\n\nAt Easter break, I flew on a half-empty plane into the eye of night. I didn’t bring her flowers, though I thought of how they would look on a grave.\n\nI wanted her in the earth, her body contained.\n\nNot floating down a river of fire. Not knowing the words she said to me that night would burn:\n\nYour father lies. Please God, don’t hurt your mother. You were always so difficult, crying, crying. I couldn’t shut you up. You didn’t want my milk. Only your father. How could I live with myself?\n\nAfter we cried, I put out the light. I left her in that room. I closed the door behind me. \n\nTonight my roses bloom beside her bed, working their thorns into her lips, the words I never knew how to say:\n\nMother, nothing heals completely as long as I stay alive.\n"

Also, I have a particular affinity for modes of travel, for airplanes, cars, and especially trains, the no-place places of liminal time and space that enlarge my imagination. I wrote “Missed Train” as a haibun, a traditional Japanese form that pairs prose with haiku via an associative leap. The prose poem portion recalls a typical street scene near San Jose State University where I taught for over ten years—typical until the pandemic closed the campus. The haiku reinforms the memory with an image and observation  from the perspective of our new abnormal and repurposes a quote from a well-known modernist poem, another era of significant societal shock and dislocation. While “Missed Train” looks back at the before-times, the disjunctive nature of the haiku’s post-pandemic lens on a lost world, as well as the double meaning in the poem’s title, frames this San Jose story a Covid Chronicle.",

They cluster around small tables set out in front of three competing cafés that line the promenade. Farther down, a garbage can lies overturned, trash scattered. Maybe the aluminum can guy was searching again. A man speeds by on his motorized wheelchair, the aged Chihuahua crouched between his feet yapping and lunging at each passing skateboard. Another fellow shakes a paper coffee cup at a driver’s window stopped at the crosswalk where I hurry past, headed to the light rail stop dragging my wheeled backpack full of papers to grade. It grumbles against the fake cobble pressed into the pavement. Across the street, an itinerant preacher in his twenties stands on a low wall. He grasps the neck of his red electric guitar strung over a shoulder, the other hand holding an open book aloft, loudly rehearsing a sermon to no one visible. People wait for a bus near the platform where I too will have to wait for the next train. The one I just missed clangs down the street, wheels whining around the corner. Just far enough back from the smoke-free zone to be legal, people light up. When a bus pulls to the curb, the doors let off some kid wearing a black beanie studded with multi-colored buttons. He produces a ukulele from his backpack as if that’s why he came here, as if that’s what we are all waiting for. He leans against a light pole and strums a calliope-like melody for everyone, the preacher, a child now crying in its stroller, her tired mother, the departing bus’ roar, and far down the tracks, its headlight just appearing, the next train.\n\n\n\nWords left on paper.\nThe apparitions linger—\nfaces in a crowd\n\n\n"

Geocoding will allow viewers to see and interact with the phrases that have been placed back to their original location.\nOftentimes the words we carry with us are surprisingly more mundane than we might think. Useless Phrases welcomes any and all phrases that participants wish to let go of. While we hope this project brings more awareness to verbal and domestic abuse and the significance of its harmful effects on us as individuals, Useless Phrases is not limited to abusive language. Some of these useless phrases can be spoken by parents, partners, or ourselves and may seem minimal in comparison to others. However we can not compare our pain, and healing thrives in authenticity. So please send us your individual and honest useless phrase. While using geocoding won’t erase these phrases it will hopefully ease the burden of carrying them with us on a daily basis.\n\nKatharine T, Jacobs and Ian G. Fabre have combined their strengths and weaknesses to create an engaging social art project that attempts to heal and inform. \nJacobs and Fabre have come to find through their unique life experiences and individual trauma that they are inspired by a shared interest in helping others and a desire for personal growth which has led to the technological birth the concept and experience of Useless Phrases.\n",

I didn’t know how aches in my eyeballs counted as migraines. After leaving the company I went on a three-month break from computers, thinking that would fix my issue (I only got headaches when looking at computer screens) but when I slowly returned to the virtual world, I found my light-tolerance grinding down. Later I set up a lunch date (also in San Jose)  with the same co-worker who read my palm; he asked me, “You’re better now, right?” only to be surprised with the unfortunate truth. But this was only the beginning of a long and arduous saga of learning to live with a disability—one that even my doctors struggled to assist me with (my last two neurologists ejected me from their practices, citing that my condition was atypical and they couldn’t help me anymore). \n\nBecause of my disability, San Jose has been my home for the last several years. I had plans of graduate school, even flying out to scope out programs, but those drowned under the tide of new health-related problems.  Sometimes I feel ashamed about not having “overcome” like many other people with disabilities have, but, eh, each has their own journey. At least, despite the fluctuating landscape of my health, one thing has remained steadfast—my love for writing. The truest change is how I put the words on the page. So here I am, finding power and grace amidst the light.\n",

A former artist in resident at Kala Art Institute (2010) currently working as a project manager on San Jose Story Maps Project with artist, Rhonda Holberton.  Znamirowski is moved by ideas of memory, time, and change. She is known for her installations of DIY materials, drawings of women and animals, often executed with strong black and white contrasts.  Always building upon what came before, she continually re-visits her compositions, re-creating them in an attempt to copy them, while understanding the impossibility of this pursuit. She chases these ever changing differences between each art work as proof of our constantly shifting existence. \n\n\n",
