        "text submission": "Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Small Crimes throughout the San Jose area.”<br>The woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”<br>Lydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.<br>Soon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”<br>“I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.<br>“This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”<br>Lydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”<br>“I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.<br> Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”<br>The woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”<br>“I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “<br>She surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”<br>“Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”<br>Quietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.<br>When Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.<br>“How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”<br>“About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly, “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. <br><br><br>"
