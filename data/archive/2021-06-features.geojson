        "statement": "I’m a lifelong writer and poet who has also worked professionally as high school\nteacher, print journalist, network television story editor, and museum curator. My\nunwavering conviction about the importance of our human connection to each other\nand to the environment we share with all life on Earth, is central to my poetry and\nwriting.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Silicon Valley thirty-eight years ago, I wanted to explore its\nless urban as well as its burgeoning urban spaces. On weekends we often broke\nfree to travel backroads and byways that still resonated with vestiges of the earlier\nresidents, wildlife, vegetation and waterways that defined them. These day-trips\nreinforced a robust sense of the relationship of people to the land they live, work,\nand die upon.\n\nVisits to national parks and designated open spaces across the U.S., and national\nparks in other countries, inspire with their ongoing presence and accessibility the\npreservation of open spaces, despite threats to reduce their acreage for commerce.\nIn the same spirit, Santa Clara County and multiple adjacent county parks attract\nvisitors to picnic, hike, fish, and enjoy nature. They also provide local opportunities\nfor respite and remembering.\n\nSome occupations of previously rural spaces are now noticeably in transition, and\nmight eventually give way to urban expansion. Maybe this is all the more reason to\nimpart an awareness of past ways of being here into future memory—a charm\nagainst forgetting not only what has gone before, but protection today against\nover-development of living, breathing land.\n\nSan Jose is a cutting edge theater of technology for which we can be justly proud.\nI’m happily here to also celebrate some of its less obvious “under-stories” as part of\nan ongoing, land-based history of place we call home.",

        "statement": "110 Rio Robles, San Jose is the site which occupied most of my hours when I became officially diagnosed with “migraines with photophobia.” At the time I was very perplexed. I didn’t know how aches in my eyeballs counted as migraines. After leaving the company I went on a three-month break from computers, thinking that would fix my issue (I only got headaches when looking at computer screens) but when I slowly returned to the virtual world, I found my light-tolerance grinding down. Later I set up a lunch date (also in San Jose)  with the same co-worker who read my palm; he asked me, “You’re better now, right?” only to be surprised with the unfortunate truth. But this was only the beginning of a long and arduous saga of learning to live with a disability—one that even my doctors struggled to assist me with (my last two neurologists ejected me from their practices, citing that my condition was atypical and they couldn’t help me anymore). \n\nBecause of my disability, San Jose has been my home for the last several years. I had plans of graduate school, even flying out to scope out programs, but those drowned under the tide of new health-related problems.  Sometimes I feel ashamed about not having “overcome” like many other people with disabilities have, but, eh, each has their own journey. At least, despite the fluctuating landscape of my health, one thing has remained steadfast—my love for writing. The truest change is how I put the words on the page. So here I am, finding power and grace amidst the light.\n",

        "text submission": "I survived 2020 hanging out in my dear friend’s backyard under her Mulberry tree and solar-powered blinky lights, her husband serving us his excellent margaritas. She’s a sociology professor and I’m a shrink, thus we ramble, but profoundly so.  We discuss relationships, podcasts, and we also consider housing, work, feminism, and xenophobia in our San Jose.  San Jose was under our micro and macro analyses this year as we stayed home divided;  not hugging, not having birthday parties, not knowing what was coming next.  \n\nSince I’m part Portuguese, my friend later sends me part of these macro studies — a multicolored map of San Jose from 1937.  She’s been introduced some to the Santa Clara Portuguese community with their interminable masses and train-laden gowned Portuguese princesses at her church.   The brightly colored apparently cheerful map is interpreted by Mapping Inequality— published with commentary from home loan officials who sliced and diced San Jose according to color, class, immigration, and ancestry.  “Hazerdous” communities in the San Jose of 1937 included African-Americans, Japanese immigrant communities, Mexican immigrants, and Portuguese immigrants.  “You should really look at these,” my friend says, referring to quadrant D-9 in red which describes its inhabitants as “an infiltration of low-class Portuguese, Mexicans, and negroes.” \n\nI suddenly imagine me, and the dignitaries; UFW co-founder Cesar Chavez, and our nation’s poet laureate, Amanda Gorman standing in that undesirable red quadrant (very east from where I grew up in the Cambrian neighborhood — now often referred to as Willow Glen by real estate agents) near 26th street and East Santa Clara.  I’m the only one of us three in my fantasy who could potentially hopscotch out of the undesirable red square within a generation.  Sal si puedes— “get out if you can” — only facilitated with my white skin.  White skin —doing nothing but being white —trumping even Gorman’s exquisite mastery of words brought to life with her free-bird hands and harmony of inflections, and even Chavez’s saintly courage and lifetime devotion to convincing the powers that be that people need to be treated as human beings.  In this English-speaking whiteness, I never knew I was part Portuguese until I was about 15.  I remember asking my grandpa about my grandma’s vinha de alhos dish, and he— hiding his Lithuanian Ashkenazi roots (even to his death)— laughed, “Hey, be sure you don’t marry a portagee!”  \n\nMy mother, an Irish-Dutch-American nurse of Montana copper mining roots, got our family  involved in our church’s devotion to Chavez and Huerta’s Si se puede movement.  The newborns of Central Valley farm workers were being deformed by big agriculture’s pesticides, and so my brothers and I never ate grapes in our childhood.  I still feel guilty if I eat them now.  I always knew the Irish were boisterous, and that the Italian side of me allowed for homemade raviolis at Christmastime.  But the Portuguese part remained a mystery to me, hidden in the inheritance of this “low-class” status that my grandma was determined to make invisible under her French glass, British flatware, and American patriotic pride.  My mother, following Chavez’s strike, brought to the heart of our kitchen table the inequities that she wanted to teach us were social sin— even down in our tastebuds.  Stratification gets cuttingly sharp close up.  \n\nLike most Portuguese in San Jose, I’m Azorean.  My grandma was raised by her grandma, Ana Mattos who hailed from lush Faial, one of the rural farming and fishing communities in this string of nine islands.  It’s about three hours flying out into the blue Atlantic abyss from Lisbon.  Although now a hipster vacation destination, the Azores are their own kind of “definitely declining” D-9 red-lined community east adjacent to mainland Europe’s prestige.  Outside of the quadrants of racism, they are stunning island paradises full of resilient Azoreans.  My grandma, born in 1916 did not gift me with her ability to speak Portuguese, nor approve of my parent’s Catholic Church which stood in solidarity with Mexicans — she was all too aware of the dangers of revealing those dividing lines emphasized on that 1937 map decoded by my sociology professor friend and Mapping Inequality. My grandma, Eva Alberta Mattos Landucci made sure to erase all those beautiful “low-class” vowels in her name, shook that red line from her body, and shielded by her white skin, buried any traces of color that would deteriorate her children’s and grandchildren’s cultural capital.  \n"

The story is told on behalf of the many voiceless gay men and women who lived in the area during the days when gay people were rounded up and hauled off to jail—the period just before and after the Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village began to shift the oppressive view of gay-ness as criminal behavior. \n\nAs the manager of what was then the largest bookshop in the South Bay, a two-level much-loved shop that served San Jose for many years, I personally, along with the bookshop staff witnessed the persecution of gay men who were “set up” by cops pretending to be gay in the men’s bathroom just outside the downstairs bookshop entry. These men, often young boys, ran through the bookshop crying out for help and were frequently slammed into the mezzanine floor, stepped on, handcuffed, arrested and dragged out of the shop to face criminal charges. \n",

        "text submission": "Peacock\n\nJust ask any legitimate bookseller. To that person, the job isn’t “retail,” it’s a choice to stay up close and personal with physical books. Physical books—the kind we sit with, open, sometimes feel unbearable pain when the spine is broken. Those people. They work in City Lights; Shakespeare and Company; Powell’s; The Strand—inside walls that contain more than forays into the highlights of literary genre. Yes, joy visits in the shape of famous and not-so-famous writers who sign books, stay for coffee or wine with the staff. These secret moments when we feel connected to the vessel that brings the words that move us, shake us up, soothe us, tear us apart, remind us of something we’d rather forget or urge us forward. Sure, those are the perks, but they’re nothing compared to the incandescent moments that happen behind the scenes, exploding quietly, away from sales, displays, bestsellers, “great” literature. The stories that surprise, imprint on the brain, make a lasting groove. The Shirley Jackson or Octavia E. Butler moments. \nThe flat sound of a register reading a title. The punch of the price. The crinkling paper bag that swallows its prey. The flat thud of a body hitting the mezzanine floor of the bookshop. The skinny, threadlike sound arising from the silken throat of a young gay man, trapped, held down, terrified. The sound that lifts like a sparrow in flight, that hits the ceiling, floats, lands inside each customer who waits in line to purchase a prized volume. A bird fluttering, butting up against the heart wall, trapped, fighting with all its might to escape. We know this moment.\nThe cashier makes small talk with customers while the young man, in the glory of his alluring worked-out musculature, his protein shakes and club-danced body writhes in fear. In this moment, the boy is a peacock, a lavish and tender bird, an emerald translucent messenger, calling out in flight, reaching, but catching only air in his feathered grasp, trapped. His predator, cloaked in the uniform of justice, wears a badge. Police, dressed in tight t-shirts and bulging jeans hide in the Valley Fair men’s bathroom, “setting up” gay men. Officers who speak the briny lie that tortures, drags down the queens with such satisfaction. Slam a boy’s head on the landing, step on his pride, but never confess to that one hot kiss and the thrill of handcuffing his prey.\nSaturday night the young man dances wildly, flashing his youth, his precious stamina, his holiness at the Crystal, the Savoy, Renegades, the Toyon. All around him sexy love blazes, but the one guilty of being himself cannot remember this in his holding cell where incessant terror spits at him, hollows him out like termites in wood. \nThe cashier takes a break. Sits quietly in the backroom taking small bites of something. It’s the night shift even when it isn’t. The woman’s panties left on the bottom shelf in Fiction; the dead bird smashed inside the picture book of birds; the man who purchases the new book on the Pleiades that he believes to be the source of the voices that follow him home each night; the vision of Lois floating down the steps inquiring about a job, lost blue soul about to die on the freeway. \nOne morning the bulldozer arrives, ready to bite into the bookshop. Take the lid off. It’s okay. We’ve already celebrated the dire and the profound, downstairs below ground level where the great wall of books were received, where we went to tell our stories. The tunnel behind the backroom area will be filled in with giant rocks. There will be air pockets, space to hold the words we’ll leave behind. We use spray paint, magic markers, pencils, hammers to mark our sentiments, to say our holy goodbyes. Something is leaving us, but will still have room to breathe underneath the upscale mall that will rise like a bloated white whale over the same spot where Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje have lived, their voices fire rushing through trees. We write poems to Lois, to all the beautiful young men who were captured—so great was their aura—and to the broken, diseased and lost who called upon us. To the joyous who projected their love onto us. To the woman who called at 6 a.m. asking us to save her kittens. To all those who assumed we could we rise to any occasion. Powerless though we were.\n"

Also, I have a particular affinity for modes of travel, for airplanes, cars, and especially trains, the no-place places of liminal time and space that enlarge my imagination. I wrote “Missed Train” as a haibun, a traditional Japanese form that pairs prose with haiku via an associative leap. The prose poem portion recalls a typical street scene near San Jose State University where I taught for over ten years—typical until the pandemic closed the campus. The haiku reinforms the memory with an image and observation  from the perspective of our new abnormal and repurposes a quote from a well-known modernist poem, another era of significant societal shock and dislocation. While “Missed Train” looks back at the before-times, the disjunctive nature of the haiku’s post-pandemic lens on a lost world, as well as the double meaning in the poem’s title, frames this San Jose story a Covid Chronicle.",

They cluster around small tables set out in front of three competing cafés that line the promenade. Farther down, a garbage can lies overturned, trash scattered. Maybe the aluminum can guy was searching again. A man speeds by on his motorized wheelchair, the aged Chihuahua crouched between his feet yapping and lunging at each passing skateboard. Another fellow shakes a paper coffee cup at a driver’s window stopped at the crosswalk where I hurry past, headed to the light rail stop dragging my wheeled backpack full of papers to grade. It grumbles against the fake cobble pressed into the pavement. Across the street, an itinerant preacher in his twenties stands on a low wall. He grasps the neck of his red electric guitar strung over a shoulder, the other hand holding an open book aloft, loudly rehearsing a sermon to no one visible. People wait for a bus near the platform where I too will have to wait for the next train. The one I just missed clangs down the street, wheels whining around the corner. Just far enough back from the smoke-free zone to be legal, people light up. When a bus pulls to the curb, the doors let off some kid wearing a black beanie studded with multi-colored buttons. He produces a ukulele from his backpack as if that’s why he came here, as if that’s what we are all waiting for. He leans against a light pole and strums a calliope-like melody for everyone, the preacher, a child now crying in its stroller, her tired mother, the departing bus’ roar, and far down the tracks, its headlight just appearing, the next train.\n\n\n\nWords left on paper.\nThe apparitions linger—\nfaces in a crowd\n\n\n"

Using geocoding, anonymously collected “useless phrases” are placed back into their location of origin. Geocoding will allow viewers to see and interact with the phrases that have been placed back to their original location.\nOftentimes the words we carry with us are surprisingly more mundane than we might think. Useless Phrases welcomes any and all phrases that participants wish to let go of. While we hope this project brings more awareness to verbal and domestic abuse and the significance of its harmful effects on us as individuals, Useless Phrases is not limited to abusive language. Some of these useless phrases can be spoken by parents, partners, or ourselves and may seem minimal in comparison to others. However we can not compare our pain, and healing thrives in authenticity. So please send us your individual and honest useless phrase. While using geocoding won’t erase these phrases it will hopefully ease the burden of carrying them with us on a daily basis.\n\nKatharine T, Jacobs and Ian G. Fabre have combined their strengths and weaknesses to create an engaging social art project that attempts to heal and inform. \nJacobs and Fabre have come to find through their unique life experiences and individual trauma that they are inspired by a shared interest in helping others and a desire for personal growth which has led to the technological birth the concept and experience of Useless Phrases.\n",

        "text submission": "Excerpt from the first installment in a San Jose Mystery Series: Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes by Lita Kurth\n       Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes throughout the greater San Jose area.”\n      The woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”\n      Lydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.\n      Soon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”\n      “I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.\n      “This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”\n      Lydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”\n      “I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.\n Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”\n      The woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”\n      “I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “\nShe surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”\n      “Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”\n      Quietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.\nWhen Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.\n      “How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”\n      “About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly,       “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. CONTACT LITA FOR THE CONCLUSION!\n\n"

She thinks\nsleeping with men is more than a sin,\nmy father says, as we sit on the curb\nin front of someone else’s house.\nSixty-four years have made my father\nimpotent. Silver roots, faded black\ndye mottling his hair make him look\nalmost comical, as if his shame\nbelonged to me. Last night we read\nThoreau in a steak house down the road\nand wept: If a man does not keep pace\nwith his companions, let him travel\nto the music that he hears, however\nmeasured or far away. The orchards\nare gone, his village near Shanghai\nbombed by the Japanese, the groves\nI have known in Almaden—apricot,\nwalnut, peach and plum—hacked down.\n\n\n\n\t \nCanker\n\n\nThe wound would not heal for days. But that was nothing compared to my mother who ran her mouth all over my body.\n\nWhat people will do to be remembered.\n\nThe nurses cutting roses from the cards I sent have put them in a tub of scalding water. The kisses have come undone.\n\nStamps are all she can save, arranging them in a book like all the photographs she could never take.\n\nI have managed to piece together the pages she tore away from me. Though the box of letters burned, the ashes were not entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day after Christmas break, my father was driving me back to school, the two-lane highway on fire, everything falling. \n\nTo me, their divorce was never final, only a precarious extension, a bridge I had learned to walk between two cliffs.\n\nI remember blood on the dining-room floor and a few drops down his cheek when I broke a chair over his back. It wasn’t damaged beyond repair, but it was put away in the attic.\n\nAnd I thought, if only Mother knew. The county had already locked her up for the first time that year: her neighbors had complained about sacks of garbage she threw from her balcony into the swimming pool below.\n\nI still can hear her voice that day in junior high when I was called out of class. She said to me in the backseat,\n\nLove me, let me die,\n\nher head bobbing in my lap, floating in its pool of chemicals. The woman who couldn’t get in to clean drove us to the emergency room.\n\nLet me die.\n\nThat’s all I heard when I broke into her bedroom, the pills scattered on the floor like a broken necklace.\n\nShe lived. That night there was a canker in the back of my throat. I couldn’t eat for days. My father opened cans of a protein drink he’d brought home from the hospital.\n\nDrink this. Now sleep. Good.\n\nThat was the first time I remember being held. I told my father at the end of our trip. I told him about the men who came into my life. The pain that made me feel alive.\n\nMy father wept as we swerved to the side of the road. Then he began to speak, stoking a bed of ashes that years could not put out:\n\nYour aunt wrote me while you had stayed with them, still a baby. You’d scream if your mother came into the room where you were being bathed. Her sister told her not to touch you but she did.\n\nI wanted this to stop. Why couldn’t anyone stop her?\n\nThere are no photographs of you then. She wouldn’t have them in the house reminding her.\n\nMy mother entered me with a kiss.\n\nAt Easter break, I flew on a half-empty plane into the eye of night. I didn’t bring her flowers, though I thought of how they would look on a grave.\n\nI wanted her in the earth, her body contained.\n\nNot floating down a river of fire. Not knowing the words she said to me that night would burn:\n\nYour father lies. Please God, don’t hurt your mother. You were always so difficult, crying, crying. I couldn’t shut you up. You didn’t want my milk. Only your father. How could I live with myself?\n\nAfter we cried, I put out the light. I left her in that room. I closed the door behind me. \n\nTonight my roses bloom beside her bed, working their thorns into her lips, the words I never knew how to say:\n\nMother, nothing heals completely as long as I stay alive.\n"
