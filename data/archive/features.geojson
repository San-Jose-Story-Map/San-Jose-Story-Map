        "statement": "On the morning after my ninth birthday, I carried a cerise suitcase and left Sadec, Vietnam on a mythical journey that eventually led to San Jose’s Little Saigon, a land where traditional foods were cooked with slightly different ingredients and where the people spoke with newly adjusted tongues. No matter where I went, I was slightly out-of-place. And so it became, that out of the necessity to invent a place to belong, poetry found me. My poetic instincts were formed from the sights and sounds of those immigrant streets and the vibrations of roads and buildings that were both familiar and foreign. It is the poetry of a body and heart learning its new language in secrecy.",

She thinks\nsleeping with men is more than a sin,\nmy father says, as we sit on the curb\nin front of someone else’s house.\nSixty-four years have made my father\nimpotent. Silver roots, faded black\ndye mottling his hair make him look\nalmost comical, as if his shame\nbelonged to me. Last night we read\nThoreau in a steak house down the road\nand wept: If a man does not keep pace\nwith his companions, let him travel\nto the music that he hears, however\nmeasured or far away. The orchards\nare gone, his village near Shanghai\nbombed by the Japanese, the groves\nI have known in Almaden—apricot,\nwalnut, peach and plum—hacked down.\n\n\n\n\t \nCanker\n\n\nThe wound would not heal for days. But that was nothing compared to my mother who ran her mouth all over my body.\n\nWhat people will do to be remembered.\n\nThe nurses cutting roses from the cards I sent have put them in a tub of scalding water. The kisses have come undone.\n\nStamps are all she can save, arranging them in a book like all the photographs she could never take.\n\nI have managed to piece together the pages she tore away from me. Though the box of letters burned, the ashes were not entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day after Christmas break, my father was driving me back to school, the two-lane highway on fire, everything falling. \n\nTo me, their divorce was never final, only a precarious extension, a bridge I had learned to walk between two cliffs.\n\nI remember blood on the dining-room floor and a few drops down his cheek when I broke a chair over his back. It wasn’t damaged beyond repair, but it was put away in the attic.\n\nAnd I thought, if only Mother knew. The county had already locked her up for the first time that year: her neighbors had complained about sacks of garbage she threw from her balcony into the swimming pool below.\n\nI still can hear her voice that day in junior high when I was called out of class. She said to me in the backseat,\n\nLove me, let me die,\n\nher head bobbing in my lap, floating in its pool of chemicals. The woman who couldn’t get in to clean drove us to the emergency room.\n\nLet me die.\n\nThat’s all I heard when I broke into her bedroom, the pills scattered on the floor like a broken necklace.\n\nShe lived. That night there was a canker in the back of my throat. I couldn’t eat for days. My father opened cans of a protein drink he’d brought home from the hospital.\n\nDrink this. Now sleep. Good.\n\nThat was the first time I remember being held. I told my father at the end of our trip. I told him about the men who came into my life. The pain that made me feel alive.\n\nMy father wept as we swerved to the side of the road. Then he began to speak, stoking a bed of ashes that years could not put out:\n\nYour aunt wrote me while you had stayed with them, still a baby. You’d scream if your mother came into the room where you were being bathed. Her sister told her not to touch you but she did.\n\nI wanted this to stop. Why couldn’t anyone stop her?\n\nThere are no photographs of you then. She wouldn’t have them in the house reminding her.\n\nMy mother entered me with a kiss.\n\nAt Easter break, I flew on a half-empty plane into the eye of night. I didn’t bring her flowers, though I thought of how they would look on a grave.\n\nI wanted her in the earth, her body contained.\n\nNot floating down a river of fire. Not knowing the words she said to me that night would burn:\n\nYour father lies. Please God, don’t hurt your mother. You were always so difficult, crying, crying. I couldn’t shut you up. You didn’t want my milk. Only your father. How could I live with myself?\n\nAfter we cried, I put out the light. I left her in that room. I closed the door behind me. \n\nTonight my roses bloom beside her bed, working their thorns into her lips, the words I never knew how to say:\n\nMother, nothing heals completely as long as I stay alive.\n"

        "text submission": "Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Small Crimes throughout the San Jose area.”\nThe woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”\nLydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.\nSoon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”\n“I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.\n“This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”\nLydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”\n“I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.\n Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”\nThe woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”\n“I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “\nShe surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”\n“Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”\nQuietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.\nWhen Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.\n“How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”\n“About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly, “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. \n\n\n"
