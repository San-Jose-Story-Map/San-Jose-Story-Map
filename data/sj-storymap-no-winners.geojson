        "statement": "On the side of a building, this mural, sponsored by LocalColor SJ, consists of 100 individual 3’x3’ mural tiles designed and painted by local artists. The resulting 65 ft long wall comes together as a visual tapestry of images, symbols and meanings that showcases San Jose’s artistic diversity and stands as an example of the non-profit’s goals of creating collaborative opportunities for local makers. \n\nIn “The 100 Block Mural” the representation of the individual and collective come together in an interdependent representation of society. Though each tile represents an individual identity, aspiration, or life, they do not exist as wholly separate works, but rather a holistic representation of the city. Metropolitan centers are portrayed as homogenous, fast paced, loud and unfamiliar spaces. “The 100 Block Mural” pushes back on the perspective to show the breadth of life, worldviews, and experiences of individuals who live, work, and recreate throughout the city. The viewer is presented with 100 stories that contribute to the epic that is San Jose. ",

        "statement": "110 Rio Robles, San Jose is the site which occupied most of my hours when I became officially diagnosed with “migraines with photophobia.” At the time I was very perplexed. I didn’t know how aches in my eyeballs counted as migraines. After leaving the company I went on a three-month break from computers, thinking that would fix my issue (I only got headaches when looking at computer screens) but when I slowly returned to the virtual world, I found my light-tolerance grinding down. Later I set up a lunch date (also in San Jose)  with the same co-worker who read my palm; he asked me, “You’re better now, right?” only to be surprised with the unfortunate truth. But this was only the beginning of a long and arduous saga of learning to live with a disability—one that even my doctors struggled to assist me with (my last two neurologists ejected me from their practices, citing that my condition was atypical and they couldn’t help me anymore). \n\nBecause of my disability, San Jose has been my home for the last several years. I had plans of graduate school, even flying out to scope out programs, but those drowned under the tide of new health-related problems.  Sometimes I feel ashamed about not having “overcome” like many other people with disabilities have, but, eh, each has their own journey. At least, despite the fluctuating landscape of my health, one thing has remained steadfast—my love for writing. The truest change is how I put the words on the page. So here I am, finding power and grace amidst the light.\n",

        "statement": "Stretching along the Guadalupe River Trail, this monumental mural by artist Alfonso Salazar was painted as part of the third Artist-In-Residence program at San Jose Walls. The work is both a depiction of the present and past of the Muwekma Ohlone tribe and a proclamation of resistance. The group, which includes Indigenous people from across the San Francisco Bay region, was stripped of their rights in 1927, despite their continual presence in their ancestral home. This public artwork runs along Thámien Rúmmey, an ancestral site for the Muwekma Ohlone, now known as the Guadalupe River, and depicts tribal leaders, elders and the landscape and flora and fauna of the region. Central to the mural is a portrait of Muwekma Ohlone Chairwoman Charlene Nijmeh, wearing the traditional warrior eagle headpiece of the tribe. On either side of her, floating in the clouds are portraits of the elders of the tribe, while below are children engaged in traditional activities, a symbol of the continual and continuing life and traditions of the Muwekma Ohlone people. Painted in bold letters are the words “Makkin Mak Nommo (We Are Still Here).”\n\nSalazar and the San Jose Walls team worked closely with Chairwoman Nijmeh and the Muwekma Ohlone tribe to create a work of art that not only honors the history of the tribe and marks the site of the Guadalupe River, but equally serves as a statement of resistance to narratives that Indigenous communities are historical, rather than present and alive. Moreover, this work serves to beautify and revitalize the Guadalupe River Trail, thus honoring the Muwekma Ohlone through action and utilizing art as a space for community gathering and wellness.",

Piece made primarily with polygons and subdivisions and manipulation of edges.\n\nThe imagery of the lotus flower and cherry blossoms represent the flag of the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region. The respirator is iconic and a clear reference to the infamous rise of the 3M respirator to the global consciousness. The baseball bat and toppled barrier fences depict violence and struggle. \n\nThe scene is set up in a way in which the respirator is almost a shrine - a symbol of struggle and freedom. Lead slugs from fired weapons impact onto an invisible forcefield, implying that this shrine and mask itself - is impervious. \n",

The exterior pillars depict Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, and Mahatma Gandhi, whose philosophy of non-violence was an inspiration to Chavez are presented as two pillars for the work of the United Farm Workers Union, which is represented at the top of the arch through it’s symbol -- the eagle.\n\nThe opposite side pillars depict a male and female farm worker from the Salinas Valley, while the interior of the arch is dedicated to a portrait of Chavez, a nod from Baca to the activist’s humble nature. The Virgin of Guadalupe symbolically blesses Chavez’s actions, while a skull represents the deaths of farm workers from pesticides. \n\nPlaced adjacent to the Student Union building and off of an important pedestrian passageway, the Arch is designed to be circumambulated and entered. For Baca, as students and visitors to SJSU move through the arch and learn of Chavez and his work, their own bodies are symbolically transformed from witnesses to activists. ",

        "statement": "Created by Wayne Alaniz Healy and David Rivas Botello, founders of the Los Angeles based art collective East Los Streetscapers, and sculptor Alejandro De La Loza, this concrete and bronze sculpture features murals and bas-relief sculpture depicting the 1777 establishment of San José as the first civilian Spanish settlement in California. Painted in the group’s colorful signature style, which emerged from the Chicano Mural Movement of the 1960s-70’s, the murals depict the day to day lives of the unnamed settlers from their agricultural prowess to their adobe homes. \n\nThe “Commemoration of the Founding of Pueblo De Guadalupe San Jose” challenges the narrative that California was born out of the Gold Rush. Serving as a reminder that the history of European settlement in the state dates back beyond 1849. The seal of the State California bears the image of Athena, who was born fully matured from the head of Zeus. The memorial is an act of resistance to the singular narrative of American settlement, acknowledging Spanish and Mexican settlement and rule that had been present since 1697.",

Sponsored by Local Color SJ and the San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles at the site of the SoFA Pocket Park, a revitalized parking lot which now houses Veggielution’s urban demonstration garden, this group of murals is a site of resistance that depicts San José’s diverse communities through the lens of their textile arts.\n\nBeginning with the challenge of depicting textiles in two-dimensional form and translating the sensory qualities of texture and material onto a brick wall surface, the artists each utilized personal style to explore their own cultural traditions. The resulting murals depict the intricate and unique aesthetics of traditional African textiles, embroidered Huipils from Mexico and Guatemala, Japanese sashiko embroidery, Navajo blankets, Hmong batik cloths, Chinese symbols, and gingham plaid from the United States. \n\nThe site functions as a beautiful and open outdoor gallery, available and accessible to all members of the public. In this way, and through the efforts of Veggielution and the surrounding cultural institutions, it serves as a site of community dialogue, engagement, and action.\n\nThe SoFA Pocket Murals, located in the South First Area of San Jose, are a celebration of the diversity that makes up San Jose. While also standing as a symbol of resistance in the face of development. As SoFA is rejuvenated, maintaining the connection to the cultural vibrancy that has been a hallmark of the community serves as a living memory that will inspire newcomers to ask questions and seek out its cultural history.\n\nEqually as important, these murals are a welcome home to those who are from here and returning, and those who are just arriving. They are an invitation to add to the breadth of diversity of the city and a guard against forgetting the past.",

        "text submission": "\tOn Friday March 15, 2020, my boyfriend and I dressed down to only towels saw on the news of a virus spreading quickly with a high death rate.  A man from the dark, also dressed in nothing only but a towel, watched with us, laughed, and said it was nothing but the flu.  When I left The Watergarden that day, I knew, and my boyfriend knew, this place would be closed.\n\tThe first time I heard about the Watergarden was in my twenties. A friend and I saw two men enter the building as we were walking to our cars from a Billy DeFrank Center writing workshop.  He commented how gross it was for men to hookup anonymously like that, and I just nodded.  I was looking for a relationship, I was trying to set up dates, and I was going to bring a nice man home to my family.\n\tI was in a dry spell for quite some time, and I was in desperate need of some water. I researched.  What is correct bathhouse etiquette?  What is the Watergarden?  An article called “Both Sides Now” by Richard Sine from 1996 he popped up describing how the Watergarden operates, and then I read this section:\n\nMany men who meet at the Watergarden later become good friends or long-term lovers. John Gamber, the general manager, estimates that hundreds of men who met at the Watergarden have married since the bathhouse opened in 1977. A few of them have been wed at the facility itself. \n\nAt a gay bathhouse?  I didn’t have my hopes up, but the stories like this of how people met, how they promoted safe sex, and just the idea of going to gay resort appealed to me.  I decided one morning morning that I’d go.  I was so nervous I arrived too early for their pool pass special and paid full price.  When I walked in it was nothing but light.  They turned on the lights to clean up the hallways and rooms.  California summer sun bright outside where the pool, a row of lawn chairs, and the hot tub were.  Wading in the hot tub was a warm way to end a productive visit.\n\tAnd there were many visits.  On my second visit, I met the man who became my boyfriend.  After meeting weekly for three months, he told me he loved me in a deluxe room of the Watergarden.  I didn’t respond right away and told him I had to think about.  The next week, I told him I loved him back, but with conditions.  \n\tThere were days I went by myself. I learned when to say I was from San Jose, and when to say I’m not from San Jose. Or to say my name was the cold but loving Darcy or just not to say my name at all.  A man once introduced himself to me as Fred Flinstone.  Another the former chancellor of a prestigious college, and when I looked up his name he was telling the truth. Once, a group of us sat around watching Medea goes to Jail, and laughed when Medea went to jail and cheered when she was set free.  I sang Happy Birthday to many people.  \nMy boyfriend and I would continue to meet at the Watergarden as well.  It was our getaway from our separate crowded multigenerational Bay Area homes. The Watergarden was a place, at least for six hours, that was just our own space.  Where we could be together, eat some lunch at Sushi Infinity across the street, and go back to sleep because were content and full.  We would be with friends at some parties they threw.  On Christmas you’d see Christmas cards from former patrons on the wall. My boyfriend and I held each other as it turned to the New Year, 2020.  \n\tWe hoped the Watergarden would be closed for a couple months, but it went out of business. At the end of an article about who bought the property one expert said, “The site has a bright future.”   But there was a bright past.  A piece of what some gay or bisexual men knew of San Jose, where, yes, to hookup, but those love connections did happen.  Especially when many men, including myself, fell in love with the space.\t\n\n"

Like most interesting places, San Jose is a blend of many components, some use the image of a salad, others use the image of a stew. No image or metaphor can adequately express the sources and changes that have molded San Jose. From the First Peoples who inhabited the area before the arrival of the Spanish through the growth of agriculture and the arrival of Portuguese and other communities of workers there was change. Change continued, technology grew in place of apricots and San Jose gained more people, many from Viet Nam and other parts of Asia. San Jose became the home to Low Riders and wonderful Pho and great technology. Key to this rich and vibrant San Jose is people, people who make San Jose their home.\n    The Capitol Square Mall is one of the places where the people of San Jose shop. At one time it had an independent video store, a Montgomery Wards, a Lucky supermarket and a diner which advertised their fine traditional breakfasts. Now Capitol Square Mall reflects change. The video store is long gone, eclipsed by chain stores such as Hollywood Video which in turn gave way to streaming services. The diner is now TK Noodle  The Lucky Supermarket  is no longer there, now there is Cardenas Market where one can practice their Spanish while shopping the produce section. And there is a Starbucks next to the market. Actually there is a second Starbucks for those in the know. Some years back the Montgomery Wards was torn down and a Target was built; and in that Target store is another Starbucks to provide caffeine to those in San Jose at the intersection of McKee Road and Capitol Avenue.\n"

No matter where I went, I was slightly out-of-place. And so it became, that out of the necessity to invent a place to belong, poetry found me. My poetic instincts were formed from the sights and sounds of those immigrant streets and the vibrations of roads and buildings that were both familiar and foreign. It is the poetry of a body and heart learning its new language in secrecy.",

The fragility of women’s rights are front of mind with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsberg and the impending appointment of Amy Coney Barrett. I chose a stereotypical feminine pastel pink palette to represent the uncertainty of a woman’s role in the world that will be defined by a Conservative court. I wanted the space to be beautiful at first but disquieting upon closer inspection. Symbols of our institutional strength are cracking or on rocky, uncertain ground. The rocky column on a fragile glass pedestal is placed to the right of center to represent the court moving to the right. On the far left wall, a 28 light installation represents birth control and a woman’s autonomy over her own body.  \n\nI also wanted to evoke our climate emergency and the potentially catastrophic power the court has to alter climate policy. The orb represents our Mother Earth, overpopulated, and morphed into a toxic planet. For the scale of the orb, I was inspired by Andres Reiseinger proposal for a gallery show in which he uses a giant orb to create an uncomfortable experience for the viewer. I wanted to similarly create discomfort with the inescapable scale of this impregnated wall. There is a gallery bench placed uncomfortably close to the orb to represent the overwhelming scale and discomfort of the climate crisis.",

Hicks\nArtist’s Statement\nSan Jose Storyboard Project\nMay 2021\n\n\nAs a writer and poet, I believe it is my “job” to observe and describe what I see. “Peacock” describes a marginalized San Jose community by telling one story of prejudice culminating in carefully crafted and planned physical and emotional violence toward gay people at a particular time period within San Jose’s history. \n\n“Peacock” describes incidents that occurred in San Jose at the former Valley Fair Mall before it was demolished and replaced with the current mega-mall, Westfield. The story is told on behalf of the many voiceless gay men and women who lived in the area during the days when gay people were rounded up and hauled off to jail—the period just before and after the Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village began to shift the oppressive view of gay-ness as criminal behavior. \n\nAs the manager of what was then the largest bookshop in the South Bay, a two-level much-loved shop that served San Jose for many years, I personally, along with the bookshop staff witnessed the persecution of gay men who were “set up” by cops pretending to be gay in the men’s bathroom just outside the downstairs bookshop entry. These men, often young boys, ran through the bookshop crying out for help and were frequently slammed into the mezzanine floor, stepped on, handcuffed, arrested and dragged out of the shop to face criminal charges. \n",

        "text submission": "Peacock\n\nJust ask any legitimate bookseller. To that person, the job isn’t “retail,” it’s a choice to stay up close and personal with physical books. Physical books—the kind we sit with, open, sometimes feel unbearable pain when the spine is broken. Those people. They work in City Lights; Shakespeare and Company; Powell’s; The Strand—inside walls that contain more than forays into the highlights of literary genre. Yes, joy visits in the shape of famous and not-so-famous writers who sign books, stay for coffee or wine with the staff. These secret moments when we feel connected to the vessel that brings the words that move us, shake us up, soothe us, tear us apart, remind us of something we’d rather forget or urge us forward. Sure, those are the perks, but they’re nothing compared to the incandescent moments that happen behind the scenes, exploding quietly, away from sales, displays, bestsellers, “great” literature. The stories that surprise, imprint on the brain, make a lasting groove. The Shirley Jackson or Octavia E. Butler moments. \nThe flat sound of a register reading a title. The punch of the price. The crinkling paper bag that swallows its prey. The flat thud of a body hitting the mezzanine floor of the bookshop. The skinny, threadlike sound arising from the silken throat of a young gay man, trapped, held down, terrified. The sound that lifts like a sparrow in flight, that hits the ceiling, floats, lands inside each customer who waits in line to purchase a prized volume. A bird fluttering, butting up against the heart wall, trapped, fighting with all its might to escape. We know this moment.\nThe cashier makes small talk with customers while the young man, in the glory of his alluring worked-out musculature, his protein shakes and club-danced body writhes in fear. In this moment, the boy is a peacock, a lavish and tender bird, an emerald translucent messenger, calling out in flight, reaching, but catching only air in his feathered grasp, trapped. His predator, cloaked in the uniform of justice, wears a badge. Police, dressed in tight t-shirts and bulging jeans hide in the Valley Fair men’s bathroom, “setting up” gay men. Officers who speak the briny lie that tortures, drags down the queens with such satisfaction. Slam a boy’s head on the landing, step on his pride, but never confess to that one hot kiss and the thrill of handcuffing his prey.\nSaturday night the young man dances wildly, flashing his youth, his precious stamina, his holiness at the Crystal, the Savoy, Renegades, the Toyon. All around him sexy love blazes, but the one guilty of being himself cannot remember this in his holding cell where incessant terror spits at him, hollows him out like termites in wood. \nThe cashier takes a break. Sits quietly in the backroom taking small bites of something. It’s the night shift even when it isn’t. The woman’s panties left on the bottom shelf in Fiction; the dead bird smashed inside the picture book of birds; the man who purchases the new book on the Pleiades that he believes to be the source of the voices that follow him home each night; the vision of Lois floating down the steps inquiring about a job, lost blue soul about to die on the freeway. \nOne morning the bulldozer arrives, ready to bite into the bookshop. Take the lid off. It’s okay. We’ve already celebrated the dire and the profound, downstairs below ground level where the great wall of books were received, where we went to tell our stories. The tunnel behind the backroom area will be filled in with giant rocks. There will be air pockets, space to hold the words we’ll leave behind. We use spray paint, magic markers, pencils, hammers to mark our sentiments, to say our holy goodbyes. Something is leaving us, but will still have room to breathe underneath the upscale mall that will rise like a bloated white whale over the same spot where Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje have lived, their voices fire rushing through trees. We write poems to Lois, to all the beautiful young men who were captured—so great was their aura—and to the broken, diseased and lost who called upon us. To the joyous who projected their love onto us. To the woman who called at 6 a.m. asking us to save her kittens. To all those who assumed we could we rise to any occasion. Powerless though we were.\n"

The single chair at the head of the table is bronze with a wooden seat facing west towards Cesar Chavez Plaza representing his balance as a field worker and scholar. Lesser known than the table and chair: there are paved Ribbons of Terrazzo, which have bronze texts in Spanish and English with personal notes about Dr. Galarza from family, friends, and colleagues. \n\n“Man on Fire” captures the influence of place and the individual on each other. Dr. Galarza’s work was framed in the geography of the San Joaquin Valley and the division between white and Mexican farm workers. His work also transformed the place from one of division to cooperation that laid the groundwork for the introduction of Mexican history to the schools. “Man on Fire” resists the separation of place and the individual to show the symbiotic relationship at work and his role in the formation of both.",

        "statement": "When the COVID19 pandemic began to spread across the United States, I turned to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease’s Flickr account. I knew from previous experience that this would be where the United State’s federal research labs would share the first electron microscope images of the virus. In those early weeks, I was rewarded with colorized photos of our bodies at war and 3D structural models of a new enemy. As an artist, I searched every image for the turmoil of this moment— for what Wassily Kandinsky called the ‘klang’— and was left wanting. So, as I held onto the scientific scenes of an invisible war, I began to delve into the metaphysical crisis of a shared isolation. Alone in my basement, I created an abstract photographic series in which I imagined the microscopic landscapes of the human body as emotional and energized compositions. Using glass microscope slides and acrylic ink, I created boldly colored image plates and photographed them on a high resolution scanner. The resulting photos are expressive and abstract, while also hinting at the microscopic drama playing out within our bodies.",

Rendering the iconic moment through details such as the gloved hands and shoeless feet of the two athletes, Rigo 23 shows that the gesture was not accidental but planned for maximal symbolic effect.\n\nReenacted at SJSU in monumental form, Smith and Carlos’s protest and call towards justice is uplifted and celebrated. The second place podium spot, left empty, invites spectators to imagine themselves alongside the two icons and to follow their example in pledging to take responsibility and action towards eradicating anti-Black racism and bias.

The image seemed appropriate. \n\tI had new wife and a new job SJS not (yet U) but almost no money, but we needed rest and showers. There was enough for one night in a hotel and we ended up at Hotel Montgomery then at the center of town. (Later it was moved 187 feet and is now Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown). All night long, the same noisy cars circled round and rounded round. Next day we had to find a place to rent or we would have to dig into our month-in-advance rent money.  Incredibly, we found a cottage on a rich man’s estate in the hills above Alum Rock Park. From the lawn by the front yard swimming pool we could see a host of plum trees sweeping almost all the way to the Bay. The rent was 95 dollars a month.\n\tOn a bright shiny November morning, I walked out of my English Lit class in the Journalism Building to the news that President Kennedy had been shot.  It wasn’t clear whether it was fatal. There were desperate hopes that it wasn’t, but, alas..., and the lamentations of a nation which could not believe or comprehend the fate it had been asked to live through began.\n\tMy wife and I had no television set but our landlord invited us to look at the news with him and his family and for hours, over several days, we sprawled in chairs in his bedroom where the big set was, watching with tear-filled eyes a country trying to cope. \n\tOn the second or third day of grieving,  I heard familiar music, and looked up at the set. My graduate school, Rutgers, had a fine University Chorus that sang a concert a year with the Philadelphia Orchestra.  My last semester, it was Brahms German Requiem. There was Ormandy, the orchestra, and my old choir. They had been gathered quickly for a memorial service. I sang along as best as I could with my quavery voice.\n"

My\nunwavering conviction about the importance of our human connection to each other\nand to the environment we share with all life on Earth, is central to my poetry and\nwriting.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Silicon Valley thirty-eight years ago, I wanted to explore its\nless urban as well as its burgeoning urban spaces. On weekends we often broke\nfree to travel backroads and byways that still resonated with vestiges of the earlier\nresidents, wildlife, vegetation and waterways that defined them. These day-trips\nreinforced a robust sense of the relationship of people to the land they live, work,\nand die upon.\n\nVisits to national parks and designated open spaces across the U.S., and national\nparks in other countries, inspire with their ongoing presence and accessibility the\npreservation of open spaces, despite threats to reduce their acreage for commerce.\nIn the same spirit, Santa Clara County and multiple adjacent county parks attract\nvisitors to picnic, hike, fish, and enjoy nature. They also provide local opportunities\nfor respite and remembering.\n\nSome occupations of previously rural spaces are now noticeably in transition, and\nmight eventually give way to urban expansion. Maybe this is all the more reason to\nimpart an awareness of past ways of being here into future memory—a charm\nagainst forgetting not only what has gone before, but protection today against\nover-development of living, breathing land.\n\nSan Jose is a cutting edge theater of technology for which we can be justly proud.\nI’m happily here to also celebrate some of its less obvious “under-stories” as part of\nan ongoing, land-based history of place we call home.",

So far, that has evaded me because all my frothy little pieces turn into much deeper work when I expand them.\nBut this little mystery series--perhaps I could call it “flash mysteries”?--may finally accomplish that lighter purpose. I love San Jose and the tremendous variety of cool people who make it the hidden treasure it is. That’s why I gave my protagonist a multi-ethnic identity using surnames one can easily find in San Jose. I’ve long wanted to set a mystery series here, looking at our quirks and foibles (in a mostly loving way) and our gifts and talents while promoting laughter and hope. I also teach creative writing at De Anza and CreatorSchoolCA.com and private workshops where I've met so many creative San Joseans (Is that the name for San Jose residents?) \n",

        "text submission": "Excerpt from the first installment in a San Jose Mystery Series: Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes by Lita Kurth\n       Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Tiny Crimes throughout the greater San Jose area.”\n      The woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”\n      Lydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.\n      Soon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”\n      “I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.\n      “This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”\n      Lydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”\n      “I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.\n Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”\n      The woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”\n      “I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “\nShe surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”\n      “Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”\n      Quietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.\nWhen Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.\n      “How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”\n      “About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly,       “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. CONTACT LITA FOR THE CONCLUSION!\n\n"

The prosthetic is also a result of social anxiety. Being able to express myself as I am is much easier in smaller and more intimate relations.",

Franco works with a deep sense of responsibility to his traditional Mexican artistic roots, while focusing on giving back to the community through his mural work.\n\nThe restaurant, Mezcal, where the mural calls home, is named after a traditional spirit of southern Mexico, based on the fermented and aged sap of the maguey cactus. Many sacred aspects of indigenous culture are represented in this mural, connecting the building itself to a rich history which originated in Mexico, but is still alive and well, taking on new form and significance in San José today. Representing the mystical qualities of the mezcal is a 15-foot tall Nuestra Señora Immaculada de Juquila, patron goddess of the maguey plant.\n\nThe deity is depicted growing out of a bowl of black clay pottery which has its own place in the spiritual lore of the Oaxacan region. The famous black mole, which is the signature dish at the restaurant, is represented in the mural as well, visually representing in a way a secret code, one that is shared by the Zapotec people, embedded in their collective DNA, that is made manifest through their artistic and culinary traditions. This rich imagery speaks the story of the various indigineous groups from these regions in southern Mexico that live in San José, along with the owners and workers of the restaurant Mezcal.",

        "statement": "Produced by California-based Japanese artist, Harumo Sato, as part of the 2018 San Jose Walls mural program, this colorful abstract, painted on the side of 35-year old Dac Phuc Vietnamese restaurant, is a testament to the fact that public art doesn’t have to focus on difficult histories or moments of trauma to be a site of protest and action. Playful, joyful, energetic, colorful, Sato’s work uses pattern, mythology and biomorphic forms to explore the artist’s vision for a more healthy and peaceful world, one that embraces the fact that chaos and challenges are meaningful and unescapable.\n\nThese goals are mirrored in the larger San Jose Walls program, which brings contemporary artists to San Jose yearly in a live festival of art, music and community engagement. Working with and among the community, artists create work in their unique personal styles and their chosen subject matter. The resulting murals not only enhance and brighten the experience of locals and visitors as they make their way around the city, but serve as sites of resistance to narratives of urban decay. Instead, created as accessible and highly visible art spaces, these murals invite all to consider the thriving and diverse communities that make up San Jose.\n\n“Celebration Under the Water” recognizes the story of Vietnamese Americans in the Bay Area in depicting the moves beyond the narrative of the Vietnam War to show that there is more below the surface. Vibrant colors illustrate the pleasure of life that occurs beneath the turbulence of the waves above. While the focus of the historical narrative may be on the conflict and trauma from half a world away there is a broader more complex story of life, joy, chaotic order, and community. The mural challenges the viewer to resist focusing on the strife of the rough seas to see the community that can flourish when diverse peoples come together in an ecosystem of respect forming a symbiotic society.

        "text submission": "Lydia Rotini’s cell phone buzzed, and although her lunch break was not quite over, the thought of human suffering made her swallow the last bite of banh mi sandwich, clear her throat, and answer, “Lydia Rotini Hernandez-Nguyen, Specialist in Small Crimes throughout the San Jose area.”\nThe woman on the other end could scarcely speak through her sobs. “A terrible crime has been committed in Willow Glen. Please I need your help.”\nLydia was unsurprised. Willow Glen was a seething cauldron of small crime. Soothingly, she asked for the address, and after doublechecking that her best camera and crime scene tools were packed into her colorful Laurel Birch bag, she headed out to an address on Camino Palomino. When she reached the enormous fenced chateau, a big cardboard box stood in front of its locked iron gate, and she had to reach over it to ring the bell.\nSoon enough, a stylish older woman hurried down the walkway worry written all over her face in capital letters. “Are you Lydia?”\n“I am, madam,” Lydia said in comforting tones.\n“This morning I opened my gate to something I hope I never see again. I still can’t believe it happened. Someone dumped a bucket of dead leaves right in front of my gate!”\nLydia’s brow furrowed. “Oh dear. I’m very sorry to hear that.”\n“I preserved the evidence,” the woman said and lifted the cardboard box.\n Immediately Lydia could see why the woman had said it was a bucket of dead leaves because this leaves were wet and held the shape of a bucket very clearly. Lydia regarded her gravely. “You’ve shown tremendous presence of mind. Sometimes in the midst of trauma, people unthinkingly destroy evidence.”\nThe woman's blue eyes brimmed with tears. “Can you believe the police wouldn’t come for this?”\n“I can believe it, madam,” Lydia said, “but I cannot condone it. I shall endeavor to get to the bottom of this as well as the middle and the top. “\nShe surveyed the crime scene, “After I’ve done my initial physical investigation, I shall need to ask you some questions.”\n“Just ring the bell when you’ve finished, and I’ll let you into the house.” The woman dabbed the tears from her cheeks with a linen handkerchief. “And thank you.”\nQuietly pleased to be of service to the suffering, Lydia bent down with her tape measure and measured the top and bottom diameters of the dead leaf pile as well as its height. She photographed it from every angle and put on latex gloves to take a sample. Since it was November, they were particularly beautiful leaves which Lydia recognized as Chinese pistache. She picked up the leaf, sniffed it and recorded the odor: nutlike and autumny, with an earthy undertone. She crinkled one in her hand, then put it in a plastic ziplock bag.\nWhen Lydia entered the chateau, the woman had laid out tea on a lovely trolley. Beside the teacups and exquisite Japanese teapot was a lace doily and on the doiley sat a bone china plate and on the plate sat several croissants that smelled exquisite.\n“How could someone do such a thing?” The woman asked in a heartbroken voice, adding “Cream and sugar?”\n“About a fourth cup of cream, thank you,” Lydia said. “No sugar.” She took a sip of tea. My but it was excellent. She looked toward the distant other side of the room and said somberly, “I, a mere detective,  cannot pretend to plumb the depths of evil and madness that I encounter daily in San Jose. How could I? Philosophers and theologians have contemplated these questions for centuries and have not come to agreement. \n\n\n"

        "statement": "Created by Japanese American modernist sculptor Ruth Asawa, this memorial, located outside of the Federal Building, commemorates the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese and Japanese-American residents of California during WWII.\n\nSculpted in bas-relief bronze, the memorial depicts key aspects of the Japanese American experience, before and after the WWII with a central focus on the experience of the incarcerated Japanese Americans during the war. The mural includes scenes of immigration, community life and agricultural labor and alongside symbols of the incarceration camps, including barracks, barbed wire, a watch tower, and heavily armed soldiers.\n\nThe whole is accompanied by text panels that include Executive Order no. 9066 by which relocation to internment was ordained, maps of internment camps, and other historical documents. A native Californian, Asawa  herself, spent four years at an internment camp in Rohwer, Arkansas along with her family. \n\nWhile the memorial symbolically commemorates the experience of all Japanese Americans, it has a special poignancy in San Jose, whose thriving Japanese and Japanese- American community experienced forced removal, incarceration and loss of property as a result of Executive Order no. 9066. Moreover, On May 24 and 25, 1942, San Jose State University served as a registration site for local residents of Japanese descent prior to their forced removal and incarceration. \n\nThe “Japanese Internment Memorial” pushes the view to resist the urge to assign the injustices of the past to the yellowed pages of history. Memorializing the relocation and removal of Japanese Americans during World War II serves as an inflection point for considering the treatment of different groups today – where there is a failure to extend dignity, equality, and justice.\n\nThe placement of the memorial at the Federal Building recalls the actions of the United States government to act without dignity, equality, and justice and serves as a permanent protest against the violation of civil and human rights.

To the best of my knowledge, he was never identified, so his next of kin could never be notified. This was a tragic and somewhat unusual occurrence, but it serves to highlight the invisibility common to the homeless men, women, and children who live among us, yet who are set apart by a wall of fear and shame. They are pushed to the margins of society, but also to the margins of consciousness. Their near-invisibility allows the rest of us to forget their very existence—and when we forget they exist we don't feel any pressure to provide the resources they need to stay safe, healthy, and alive. This sonnet is a small memorial to a man who may not have received any other. He loved hot chocolate, cold beer, and mystery novels.",

        "statement": "Useless Phrases is a social art project that attempts to ease the burden of the useless, hurtful, or abusive phrases that we carry with us through our lives. Using geocoding, anonymously collected “useless phrases” are placed back into their location of origin. Geocoding will allow viewers to see and interact with the phrases that have been placed back to their original location.\nOftentimes the words we carry with us are surprisingly more mundane than we might think. Useless Phrases welcomes any and all phrases that participants wish to let go of. While we hope this project brings more awareness to verbal and domestic abuse and the significance of its harmful effects on us as individuals, Useless Phrases is not limited to abusive language. Some of these useless phrases can be spoken by parents, partners, or ourselves and may seem minimal in comparison to others. However we can not compare our pain, and healing thrives in authenticity. So please send us your individual and honest useless phrase. While using geocoding won’t erase these phrases it will hopefully ease the burden of carrying them with us on a daily basis.\n\nKatharine T, Jacobs and Ian G. Fabre have combined their strengths and weaknesses to create an engaging social art project that attempts to heal and inform. \nJacobs and Fabre have come to find through their unique life experiences and individual trauma that they are inspired by a shared interest in helping others and a desire for personal growth which has led to the technological birth the concept and experience of Useless Phrases.\n",

        "statement": "By Lindsley Britton, Art174, Fall 2021, SJSU\n\n“Urban Room’s” structure consists of elevated “rooms” formed out of brightly colored vinyl-coated chain-link fences decorated with colored diamonds. The chain link structures sit on steel edifices, creating additional “rooms” below, shaded by the chain link latticework and black fabric canopies stretched between the sections. The result is an inviting open space adjacent to a stage used to host events and community gatherings.\n\nThe shaded area and event stage transform the park into a platform for block parties, community gatherings, and organized events in San José’s arty SoFA District. Between events, there are picnic tables situated in the shaded areas, providing an informal neighborhood gathering space. Viewed from the street, the large, elevated “rooms” provide a colorful addition to the narrow strip of a park, reminiscent of colorful playground equipment. \n\nUrban Rooms is a public art piece about land use and communal space adaptation in the cultural production site of downtown San José. By choosing chain link fence as a building material, the design team invites dialogue about community and spatial division. Fences are designed to separate and divide, but by lifting the fences overhead to provide shade, their function is renegotiated.\n\nStudio Teddy Cruz and Foreman have received international accolades for innovative  flexible housing based on informal architecture. “Urban Rooms” encourages resistance of the individual in favor of a communal space. Transforming the elements that would segment people, land, and communities to features that bridge division to form community.\n\nDecentering the concept of individual space results in an experience where the viewer becomes a participant in critique of land tenure and use. Mimicking Indigenous villages, the structures demonstrate the interdependence between the individual and community. How neither can be whole without the other.",

However, it always stays closest to you and protects you. Family are the closest people to you but could be the most annoying ones. I designed this postcard thinking about my family in Japan. I have not seen my family for over two years. This postcard could go back to Japan for me, stay with them, and protect them but in the most annoying way. \nYamaori (Mountain fold) and Taniori (Valley fold) lines are from Origami practice. When you repeat Yamaori and Taniori, you will make a bellow, which is suitable for a mask. The message on the Taniori area will be hidden after making folds. Therefore, you won't see the Japanese message. This is the representation of how my personality changes based on what language I am speaking and where I am. I tend to be shyer in Japanese especially when it comes to talking to my family. Japanese family usually never say \"I miss you\" or \"I love you\" to each other. Also, it is easy to say \"thank you\" via text when I am in the US, but it is hard to say in person when I go back to Japan.",

She thinks\nsleeping with men is more than a sin,\nmy father says, as we sit on the curb\nin front of someone else’s house.\nSixty-four years have made my father\nimpotent. Silver roots, faded black\ndye mottling his hair make him look\nalmost comical, as if his shame\nbelonged to me. Last night we read\nThoreau in a steak house down the road\nand wept: If a man does not keep pace\nwith his companions, let him travel\nto the music that he hears, however\nmeasured or far away. The orchards\nare gone, his village near Shanghai\nbombed by the Japanese, the groves\nI have known in Almaden—apricot,\nwalnut, peach and plum—hacked down.\n\n\n\n\t \nCanker\n\n\nThe wound would not heal for days. But that was nothing compared to my mother who ran her mouth all over my body.\n\nWhat people will do to be remembered.\n\nThe nurses cutting roses from the cards I sent have put them in a tub of scalding water. The kisses have come undone.\n\nStamps are all she can save, arranging them in a book like all the photographs she could never take.\n\nI have managed to piece together the pages she tore away from me. Though the box of letters burned, the ashes were not entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day after Christmas break, my father was driving me back to school, the two-lane highway on fire, everything falling. \n\nTo me, their divorce was never final, only a precarious extension, a bridge I had learned to walk between two cliffs.\n\nI remember blood on the dining-room floor and a few drops down his cheek when I broke a chair over his back. It wasn’t damaged beyond repair, but it was put away in the attic.\n\nAnd I thought, if only Mother knew. The county had already locked her up for the first time that year: her neighbors had complained about sacks of garbage she threw from her balcony into the swimming pool below.\n\nI still can hear her voice that day in junior high when I was called out of class. She said to me in the backseat,\n\nLove me, let me die,\n\nher head bobbing in my lap, floating in its pool of chemicals. The woman who couldn’t get in to clean drove us to the emergency room.\n\nLet me die.\n\nThat’s all I heard when I broke into her bedroom, the pills scattered on the floor like a broken necklace.\n\nShe lived. That night there was a canker in the back of my throat. I couldn’t eat for days. My father opened cans of a protein drink he’d brought home from the hospital.\n\nDrink this. Now sleep. Good.\n\nThat was the first time I remember being held. I told my father at the end of our trip. I told him about the men who came into my life. The pain that made me feel alive.\n\nMy father wept as we swerved to the side of the road. Then he began to speak, stoking a bed of ashes that years could not put out:\n\nYour aunt wrote me while you had stayed with them, still a baby. You’d scream if your mother came into the room where you were being bathed. Her sister told her not to touch you but she did.\n\nI wanted this to stop. Why couldn’t anyone stop her?\n\nThere are no photographs of you then. She wouldn’t have them in the house reminding her.\n\nMy mother entered me with a kiss.\n\nAt Easter break, I flew on a half-empty plane into the eye of night. I didn’t bring her flowers, though I thought of how they would look on a grave.\n\nI wanted her in the earth, her body contained.\n\nNot floating down a river of fire. Not knowing the words she said to me that night would burn:\n\nYour father lies. Please God, don’t hurt your mother. You were always so difficult, crying, crying. I couldn’t shut you up. You didn’t want my milk. Only your father. How could I live with myself?\n\nAfter we cried, I put out the light. I left her in that room. I closed the door behind me. \n\nTonight my roses bloom beside her bed, working their thorns into her lips, the words I never knew how to say:\n\nMother, nothing heals completely as long as I stay alive.\n"

        "statement": "By Adrienne Defendi, Art 174, Fall 2021, SJSU\n\nCreated by renowned artist and muralist, El Mac, in collaboration with writer and artist, Chris Myers, the arts collective The Propeller Group, the urban contemporary arts gallery Empire 7 Studios, and The San José Museum of Art and the Children’s Discovery Museum, “Sophie Holding the World Together” brightens the San José urban Discovery Park and offers a striking symbol of hope and human presence that dominates the wide-open green park. The young girl, at a colossal scale, holds in her hands the world (a globe) and a lotus flower (symbol of humble beginnings). Her arms are raised high in ritual, strength, reverence, openness and acceptance. She looks just slightly down on us (her chin ever so slightly tucked in) the imperative urgency.\n\nThe mural hums with dynamic energy; and indeed the two portals, which lead to the Children Discovery Museum’s arcade where artists and musicians often perform, welcome the public and further encourage openness and fluidity, community and culture. The child in this mural, however, is neither mythological nor fantastical, but represents a brave and self-possessed seven year-old from Los Angeles named Sophie Cruz, an American activist who advocates to protect the undocumented and fights for United States immigration reform. Though she is an American citizen, her parents are undocumented (in contemporary terminology she is of a “mixed-status family”) and she lives, still today, in fear that ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) will deport her parents back to Mexico, her family’s country of origin.\n\n“Sophie Holding the World Together” challenges the viewer to decenter themselves and attempt to perceive the world through the eyes of a young woman. In stepping back and considering her perspective on what the world would be like if empathy were employed in immigration policies and practices. The representation of the hope of a new life and the potential to contribute to the betterment of the world is asking the viewer to resist taking the easy path in seeing immigration as an issue and not as a human experience that deserves understanding and compassion.

        "text submission": "I survived 2020 hanging out in my dear friend’s backyard under her Mulberry tree and solar-powered blinky lights, her husband serving us his excellent margaritas. She’s a sociology professor and I’m a shrink, thus we ramble, but profoundly so.  We discuss relationships, podcasts, and we also consider housing, work, feminism, and xenophobia in our San Jose.  San Jose was under our micro and macro analyses this year as we stayed home divided;  not hugging, not having birthday parties, not knowing what was coming next.  \n\nSince I’m part Portuguese, my friend later sends me part of these macro studies — a multicolored map of San Jose from 1937.  She’s been introduced some to the Santa Clara Portuguese community with their interminable masses and train-laden gowned Portuguese princesses at her church.   The brightly colored apparently cheerful map is interpreted by Mapping Inequality— published with commentary from home loan officials who sliced and diced San Jose according to color, class, immigration, and ancestry.  “Hazerdous” communities in the San Jose of 1937 included African-Americans, Japanese immigrant communities, Mexican immigrants, and Portuguese immigrants.  “You should really look at these,” my friend says, referring to quadrant D-9 in red which describes its inhabitants as “an infiltration of low-class Portuguese, Mexicans, and negroes.” \n\nI suddenly imagine me, and the dignitaries; UFW co-founder Cesar Chavez, and our nation’s poet laureate, Amanda Gorman standing in that undesirable red quadrant (very east from where I grew up in the Cambrian neighborhood — now often referred to as Willow Glen by real estate agents) near 26th street and East Santa Clara.  I’m the only one of us three in my fantasy who could potentially hopscotch out of the undesirable red square within a generation.  Sal si puedes— “get out if you can” — only facilitated with my white skin.  White skin —doing nothing but being white —trumping even Gorman’s exquisite mastery of words brought to life with her free-bird hands and harmony of inflections, and even Chavez’s saintly courage and lifetime devotion to convincing the powers that be that people need to be treated as human beings.  In this English-speaking whiteness, I never knew I was part Portuguese until I was about 15.  I remember asking my grandpa about my grandma’s vinha de alhos dish, and he— hiding his Lithuanian Ashkenazi roots (even to his death)— laughed, “Hey, be sure you don’t marry a portagee!”  \n\nMy mother, an Irish-Dutch-American nurse of Montana copper mining roots, got our family  involved in our church’s devotion to Chavez and Huerta’s Si se puede movement.  The newborns of Central Valley farm workers were being deformed by big agriculture’s pesticides, and so my brothers and I never ate grapes in our childhood.  I still feel guilty if I eat them now.  I always knew the Irish were boisterous, and that the Italian side of me allowed for homemade raviolis at Christmastime.  But the Portuguese part remained a mystery to me, hidden in the inheritance of this “low-class” status that my grandma was determined to make invisible under her French glass, British flatware, and American patriotic pride.  My mother, following Chavez’s strike, brought to the heart of our kitchen table the inequities that she wanted to teach us were social sin— even down in our tastebuds.  Stratification gets cuttingly sharp close up.  \n\nLike most Portuguese in San Jose, I’m Azorean.  My grandma was raised by her grandma, Ana Mattos who hailed from lush Faial, one of the rural farming and fishing communities in this string of nine islands.  It’s about three hours flying out into the blue Atlantic abyss from Lisbon.  Although now a hipster vacation destination, the Azores are their own kind of “definitely declining” D-9 red-lined community east adjacent to mainland Europe’s prestige.  Outside of the quadrants of racism, they are stunning island paradises full of resilient Azoreans.  My grandma, born in 1916 did not gift me with her ability to speak Portuguese, nor approve of my parent’s Catholic Church which stood in solidarity with Mexicans — she was all too aware of the dangers of revealing those dividing lines emphasized on that 1937 map decoded by my sociology professor friend and Mapping Inequality. My grandma, Eva Alberta Mattos Landucci made sure to erase all those beautiful “low-class” vowels in her name, shook that red line from her body, and shielded by her white skin, buried any traces of color that would deteriorate her children’s and grandchildren’s cultural capital.  \n"

        "text submission": "METCALF ROAD\n\nThere are hidden treasures to be found in San Jose if one looks.  For me, the untrodden natural areas teeming with native flora and fauna, recalling “old California”, are the crown jewels.  Places that have been lightly touched by modern “progress”, the path less taken, are the diamonds in the rough that I seek out.\n\nMetcalf Road is such a place.  It starts at Monterey Road and serpentines eastward up Metcalf Canyon, steadily steepening to the top.  It is a jewel for those few willing to explore its secrets.  I am one of those few, possibly the only one.  \n \nMetcalf Road is my relief zone where I can escape Spring pollen and muddy trails in the winter rains and still get a good workout up the roughly 1,000’ climb. \n\nThe magic of Metcalf Road is that her riches are not apparent at first.  She doesn’t want to reveal her secrets until she has tested you to see if you are worthy of her hidden gems.  So, for years, I hiked it with my head down, pushing as hard as I could to get the exercise I needed.  No time to explore, to look at the hidden nuggets she had to offer.  I couldn’t waste time looking for hidden secrets!\n\nAnd all the while that I was head-down hiking, pushing myself to the limit, Metcalf Road was slowly working her magic on me.  \n\nAt some point, I started keeping a tally in my head of the different birds I saw such as Lazuli bunting, yellow warbler, Ash throated flycatcher, Western kingbird, says phoebe, California thrasher, Anna’s hummingbird, Northern harrier and Golden eagle to name a few.   And I became aware of some of the plants that were beginning to flower.  Each season brought a different palette; Spring saw poppies, blue and white Lupin, goldfield and the stunningly beautiful Blazing Star; Summer brought Bushmallow and elderberry; Fall produced golden Sycamores and bright red toyon berries.\n\nThis may sound like a paradise but there are also thorns in that rosy picture.  Metcalf Road is also a dumping ground.  Because of its remoteness, folks drive up and dump their trash into the canyon.  Old cars, mattresses, kids’ toys, refrigerators, tires and general trash lines the steep canyon almost all the way to the top.  There was even a dead body found in the bottom of the canyon about 20 years ago and there are currently 3 markers for people who recently died there. \n\nFor some, this would be just the excuse to never come here.  Why would anyone want to hike up a narrow, steep, dangerous windy road with trash scattered along the side?  The answer is that most wouldn’t.  But for those willing to look past the detritus of our modern civilization, they can find the beauty of old California, a hint of the pristine habitat that was here before we tried to completely muck it up.  And it’s in plain sight.  \n\nMetcalf Road is not a unique place in the world and will never become a World Heritage Site.  It is just a common road that leads from here to there.  But, like so many places that still exist, one must slow down and look for the beauty.  It is easy to be in awe of Yosemite Valley but to find that inspiration in a little relatively unknown road that is hardly on a map, that is a true find.  \n\nThe point, my friends, is that beauty and awe-inspiring nature are everywhere.  Just take a few minutes to slow down and look around.  Take a few minutes to sit quietly in your backyard and see the stories that are playing out every minute.  Look up in the sky, as when you were a young child, and see how many characters appear, morph and then disappear in the clouds.  Go out on a clear moonless night and try to count all the stars that you can see.  Stop and look closely at an interesting plant.  \n\nMetcalf Road is a non- descript, seldom used, little known road that winds its way out of San Jose.  But, because I was able to slow down and accept her riches, in spite of her attempt to hide them in the trash and lost lives, I have not only discovered a little-known gem but have found a new friend who has offered me her friendship and opened her arms to me.   I accept and treasure my new friend.  May we remain together for many years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCraige Edgerton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 2021\n"

        "statement": "I often write in short forms—prose poems, flash fiction, lyric essay—forms usually less than 750 words. Specific concrete image is central  to my work. I try to be aware of the sensory world around me, and I keep a small journal for note-taking wherever I go to record compelling observations, things that catch my attention. Also, I have a particular affinity for modes of travel, for airplanes, cars, and especially trains, the no-place places of liminal time and space that enlarge my imagination. I wrote “Missed Train” as a haibun, a traditional Japanese form that pairs prose with haiku via an associative leap. The prose poem portion recalls a typical street scene near San Jose State University where I taught for over ten years—typical until the pandemic closed the campus. The haiku reinforms the memory with an image and observation  from the perspective of our new abnormal and repurposes a quote from a well-known modernist poem, another era of significant societal shock and dislocation. While “Missed Train” looks back at the before-times, the disjunctive nature of the haiku’s post-pandemic lens on a lost world, as well as the double meaning in the poem’s title, frames this San Jose story a Covid Chronicle.",

They cluster around small tables set out in front of three competing cafés that line the promenade. Farther down, a garbage can lies overturned, trash scattered. Maybe the aluminum can guy was searching again. A man speeds by on his motorized wheelchair, the aged Chihuahua crouched between his feet yapping and lunging at each passing skateboard. Another fellow shakes a paper coffee cup at a driver’s window stopped at the crosswalk where I hurry past, headed to the light rail stop dragging my wheeled backpack full of papers to grade. It grumbles against the fake cobble pressed into the pavement. Across the street, an itinerant preacher in his twenties stands on a low wall. He grasps the neck of his red electric guitar strung over a shoulder, the other hand holding an open book aloft, loudly rehearsing a sermon to no one visible. People wait for a bus near the platform where I too will have to wait for the next train. The one I just missed clangs down the street, wheels whining around the corner. Just far enough back from the smoke-free zone to be legal, people light up. When a bus pulls to the curb, the doors let off some kid wearing a black beanie studded with multi-colored buttons. He produces a ukulele from his backpack as if that’s why he came here, as if that’s what we are all waiting for. He leans against a light pole and strums a calliope-like melody for everyone, the preacher, a child now crying in its stroller, her tired mother, the departing bus’ roar, and far down the tracks, its headlight just appearing, the next train.\n\n\n\nWords left on paper.\nThe apparitions linger—\nfaces in a crowd\n\n\n"
